# PRODIGY_DS_02


## Project Overview

This repository contains an R script for performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The script is designed to help users preprocess datasets, explore relationships between variables, and identify patterns and trends. The example dataset referenced in this project could be the Titanic dataset, which is commonly used for EDA and machine learning tasks.

## Files

- **PRODIGY_DS_02.R**: The main R script that includes all the necessary steps for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.

## Requirements

To run the R script, you will need to have R installed along with several essential packages. The script may utilize the following R packages:

- `dplyr`: For data manipulation.
- `ggplot2`: For data visualization.
- `tidyr`: For tidying the data.
- `readr`: For reading data files.
- `stringr`: For string manipulation.
- `caret`: For some additional EDA functions (if used).

You can install these packages in R using the following command:

```R
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "readr", "stringr", "caret"))
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naaahhh/PRODIGY_DS_02.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd PRODIGY_DS_02
   ```

3. Open the R script `PRODIGY_DS_02.R` in your preferred R environment (e.g., RStudio).

4. Run the script to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. The script is structured to:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
   - Generate various plots and statistics to explore relationships between variables.

5. Review the output and visualizations generated by the script to gain insights from the dataset.
